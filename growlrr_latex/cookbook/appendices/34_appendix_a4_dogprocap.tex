\subsection*{Proximate Analysis of DogCore SKU7 Formulation}

The DogCore SKU7 formulation consists primarily of high-quality powdered ingredients including whey protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, egg yolk and egg white powders, poultry hydrolysate, and lecithin. Based on industry typical nutrient profiles \cite{USDA_FoodData_Central}, the following proximate composition per 100 g pouch is representative:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}l r r r r@{}}
\toprule
Component & Protein (g) & Fat (g) & Ash (g) & Energy (kcal) \\
\midrule
DogCore SKU7 (typical) & 28---32 & 8---10 & 4---6 & 240---300 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These values are consistent with AAFCO 2023 nutrient profiles for adult maintenance in dogs \cite{AAFCO_2023}, ensuring sufficient protein for growth and maintenance, balanced fat levels for energy density, and ash content consistent with mineral fortification levels.

Supporting literature for ingredient nutritional composition includes USDA FoodData Central Database on protein digestibility in pet foods \cite{USDA_FoodData_Central,Swanson2013}.

\noindent\textbf{Design Rationale:} DogCore SKU7 is formulated with 2.0g calcium lactate to achieve a Ca:P ratio of 2.0:1 at the pouch level. This elevated ratio is intentional to compensate for the lower Ca:P ratio in CatCore pouches ($\approx$1.17:1). When paired 1:1 by weight in feeding (one DogCore pouch + one CatCore pouch + Curd Rice per meal), the composite mixture achieves a Ca:P ratio of $\approx$1.6:1, meeting the AAFCO minimum recommendation of /$ge$1.4:1 for optimal canine skeletal health and phosphorus metabolism. This design ensures nutritional adequacy across the paired feeding protocol while maintaining ingredient simplicity and production efficiency.
