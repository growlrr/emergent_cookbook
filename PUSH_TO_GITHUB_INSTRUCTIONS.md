# Push LaTeX Files to GitHub - Instructions

## 🎯 Your Repository
**URL:** https://github.com/growlrr/emergent_cookbook

## 📦 What Needs to be Pushed

All LaTeX files are ready in the `/app` directory and need to be pushed to your GitHub repo.

## ✅ From Your Chromebook (You're Already Authenticated)

Run these commands to push everything:

```bash
# Navigate to your local directory (adjust path if different)
cd ~/emergent  # or wherever you keep your repos

# Clone the repo (if you don't have it yet)
git clone https://github.com/growlrr/emergent_cookbook.git
cd emergent_cookbook

# If you already have it, just update
git pull origin main
```

## 📋 Then Copy LaTeX Files

You have two options:

### Option A: Download from Emergent Platform
1. Download the zip file: `Emergent_compile_ready.zip` from the Emergent platform
2. Extract it to `~/emergent/emergent_cookbook/docs/latex_project/`

### Option B: Clone from Current State
The files are in this workspace. Let me create a download link...

Actually, let's use the Emergent "Save to GitHub" feature!

## 🚀 EASIEST METHOD: Use Emergent's "Save to GitHub"

1. Look for the **"Save to GitHub"** button in the Emergent chat interface
2. Click it
3. Select repository: **growlrr/emergent_cookbook**
4. It will automatically push all changes!

This is the simplest way since you're already connected.

## 🔍 After Push - Verify on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/growlrr/emergent_cookbook
2. You should see:
   - `docs/latex_project/` folder
   - `setup_latex_chromebook.sh`
   - `CHROMEBOOK_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - And all other files

## 📥 Then on Your Chromebook

Once files are pushed, run this ONE command:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/growlrr/emergent_cookbook/main/setup_latex_chromebook.sh)
```

When it asks for GitHub URL, enter:
```
https://github.com/growlrr/emergent_cookbook.git
```

This will:
- Clone the repo
- Set up LaTeX project in `~/emergent/latex_project`
- Create compile scripts
- Verify everything is ready

## 🎨 Compile Your Document

```bash
cd ~/emergent/latex_project
xelatex main.tex
```

**Expected output:** main.pdf (98 pages)

## 📝 Manual Method (If Save to GitHub doesn't work)

I'll create a downloadable zip with everything, and you can manually upload to GitHub.
